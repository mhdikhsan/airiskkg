"""Does the canvas actually draw anything?

Every other check in this repository passed while the business canvas showed a
blank rectangle for three rounds of fixes. The element ids all existed, the CSS
classes were all defined, the JavaScript parsed, the endpoints returned correct
data, and 196 tests were green - because none of them ran the page. The renderer
was fine; a wiring call had landed inside `renderFindings()` instead of `init()`,
so nothing initialised until an assessment had been run.

Only one thing catches that: loading the real page in a real browser and looking
at what came out. This does that headlessly, and skips rather than pretends when
no browser is installed.

It asserts presence and rough shape, not pixels. A screenshot comparison would
fail on a font change and teach everyone to ignore it.
